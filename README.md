#This course will introduce students to Object Orientated Programming through Python.

The course is a one day workshop and is to be thought of in two parts:

---

##Introducing Python and OOP:

- Basic Python:

    - Variables
    - Conditional Statements
    - Flow Control
    - Data Structures

- Notions of Object Orientated Programming:

    - Class
    - Attribute
    - Methods
    - Inheritance

---

##Challenge

In the afternoon the students will be invited to compete (in teams) in a mini "hackathon" where they will be asked to write code that makes use of the OOP paradigm. In particular they are expected to delegate tasks within the group. See the "Supermarket_Challenge.md" file for further explanations.
