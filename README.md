#This course will introduce students to Object Orientated Programming through Python.

The course is a one day workshop and is to be thought of in two parts: a teaching component and a mini-hackathon.

---

##Introducing Python and OOP:

- Basic Python:

    - Variables
    - Conditional Statements
    - Flow Control
    - Data Structures
    - Functions

- Notions of Object Orientated Programming:

    - Class
    - Attribute
    - Methods
    - Inheritance

Slides are very much a work in progress but can be viewed [here](http://drvinceknight.github.com/Intro_to_Object_Orientated_Programming_With_Python/) - they're made using the awesome [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

##Challenge

In the afternoon the students will be invited to compete (in teams) in a mini "hackathon" where they will be asked to write code that makes use of the OOP paradigm. In particular they are expected to delegate tasks within the group. See the corresponding README file file for further explanations.

##Contents of the repo

The repo containsi:

- Slides for the course viewable [here](http://http://drvinceknight.github.com/Intro_to_Object_Orientated_Programming_With_Python).
- A Scenario Generator directory that can be used to generate artifical data needed for the challenge.
- An example exercise: `Exercise.py` and the corresponding solution `Exercise_Solution.py`
- Two python files with all code from the notes.
- An Evaluation directory that can be used to evaluate a potential solution to the challenge.
