#Group Project

---

In groups of 4 attempt to obtain to write code that would solve the following problem.

##Company:

Supermarket

##Required product:

Program to evaluate price of a shopping basket at checkout and keep count of loyalty points acquired by a given customer if he/she signs up to the loyalty program.

##Parameters:

A single csv file (per supermarket) containing a list of products with the following attributes:

- Product Name
- Product Department
- Product Price
- Product Loyalty points

##Particularities that need to be taken in to account:

- Every department is capable of assigning a particular sale to either a particular product or **all** of the products of the department. The code you write must be able to handle the application of a particular sale on any given day.
- The product list can be updated on any given day. As such your code must be able to handle a change of product attribute but also the possibility for new departments.
- Your code must be able to evaluate a given csv file containing the "baskets" for a given number of customers over a given period of time. There is an accompanying file containing information regarding the sales on each given day.

##Summary:

The following picture summarises your challenge:

![The underlying structure]()

##Evaluation:

Your code will be evaluated in terms of:

- Precision (does it work and if so is it correct? - This is an objective criteria)
- Performance (how fast is it? how does it handle bugs? - This is an objective criteria)
- Clarity (is it well written with comments in code? - This is a subjective criteria)

##Suggestion:

I suggest you proceed by clearly defining independent programming tasks and attempting to work independently whilst ensuring that each piece of code produced is capable of talking to each other piece.
