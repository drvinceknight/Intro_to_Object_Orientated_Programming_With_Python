<h1 id="group-project">Group Project</h1>
<hr />
<p>In groups of 4 attempt to write code that would solve the following problem.</p>
<h2 id="company">Company:</h2>
<p>Supermarket</p>
<h2 id="required-product">Required product:</h2>
<p>Program to evaluate total income from sales and keep count of loyalty points acquired by a given customer if he/she signs up to the loyalty program.</p>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters:</h2>
<p>The input to the problem is 3 csv files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stock report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Department</li>
<li>Name of roduct</li>
<li>Price of product</li>
<li>Loyalty points corresponding to product</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sales history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Loyalty number (0 if not signed up to loyalty program)</li>
<li>List of products bought</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Promotions history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Department</li>
<li>Promotion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="particularities-that-need-to-be-taken-in-to-account">Particularities that need to be taken in to account:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every department is capable of assigning a particular sale. The code you write must be able to handle the application of a particular sale on any given day.</li>
<li>The product list can be updated on any given day. As such your code must be able to handle a change of product attribute but also the possibility for new departments.</li>
<li>Your code must be generic so as to handle different combinations of the three above files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>
<p>The following picture summarises your challenge:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h2>
<p>Your code will be evaluated by placing it in a directory containing 3 files:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Stock_Report.csv'</li>
<li>'Sale_History.csv'</li>
<li>'Promotions_History.csv'</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code should print the sales taken to screen and output a csv file containing the Loyalty points information.</p>
<p>Your code will be evaluated in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Precision (does it work and if so is it correct? - This is an objective criteria)</li>
<li>Performance (how fast is it? how does it handle bugs? - This is an objective criteria)</li>
<li>Time taken to submit solution (This is an objective criteria)</li>
<li>Clarity (is it well written with comments in code? - This is a subjective criteria)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="suggestion">Suggestion:</h2>
<p>I suggest you proceed by clearly defining independent programming tasks and attempting to work independently whilst ensuring that each piece of code produced is capable of talking to each other piece.</p>
